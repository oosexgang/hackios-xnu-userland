#   hello            one raw-syscall program; as a RAM disk on its own it boots through mockfs
#   root.apfs        the small image: our init and test programs, etc/rc, and the launchd jobs
#                    (LaunchDaemons/), an APFS container (../tools/apfs/mkapfs.py). It travels in
#                    the payload next to the kernel (the second RAM disk, /dev/md1) and is mounted
#                    on /redwood. Rebuilt every time.
#                      RC=<file>    etc/rc: rc.launchd (default) hands process 1 to the iOS launchd
#                                   after init's checks; rc.ios runs a few iOS programs and halts

#                      REST=1       ... and the rest of them, started only when asked for (see mkjobs.py)
#                      WIFID=0      without wifid, iOS's Wi-Fi daemon, which is in by default (see below)
#                      OSLOG="..."  labels of the jobs whose os_log output goes to the console ("all": every
#                                   one of JOBS; default: only the window server, which says little)
#                      INJECT="..." the programs started with a library of ours, "LIBRARY NAME..." per line
#                                   (default: src/inject.c in backboardd, src/inject_sb.c in SpringBoard,
#                                   src/inject_media.c in mediaserverd);
#                                   init hands the list to the kernel (etc/inject.conf -> sysctl kern.exec_inject)
#                      STOREFRONT=1 ... and src/inject_store.c inside appstored: the storefront answered,
#                                   and a bag request watched for (an experiment; see that file)
#                      EXTRA="..."  more programs for /redwood/bin (files on this machine): one-off
#                                   diagnostics, which a file given as RC_JOBS can then run
#                      EXTRA_SHARE="..." directories on this machine to copy whole into /redwood/share,
#                                   each under its own name: the data a one-off diagnostic reads, when it
#                                   needs more than a program (tools/air/intrincheck.py --emit writes such
#                                   a directory). This goes into the boot volume, which every recipe
#                                   carries and which the flash recipe puts in RAM, so its size is paid
#                                   for at every boot -- a few megabytes, not more
#                      RC_JOBS=<file> what the job com.redwood.demo runs: rc.jobs (default), or
#                                   rc.jobs.unlock, which also swipes the lock screen away (for the phone,
#                                   where nothing else can touch the screen yet).
#                                   A job list cannot assume a shell. iOS 16.5's own root has none at all
#                                   -- /bin is df and ps, and nothing else -- so a line beginning /bin/sh
#                                   fails with "No such file or directory" and status 127 on a flash-root
#                                   boot. The /var/jb/bin/sh that rc.jobs.jb and rc.jobs.sileo run is the
#                                   package manager's prefix, which only a JB=1 image carries. And init
#                                   runs these lines itself (src/init.c, run_command): words split on
#                                   blanks, no quoting, no variable assignment, no redirection beyond a
#                                   trailing ">> FILE" and "&". So a program that needs a value passed to
#                                   it needs an option for it, not an environment variable -- which is why
#                                   air_run grew --buffer.
#                      GL=1         with an OpenGL ES implementation for the window server: Mesa
#                                   (tools/mk-mesa.sh fetches and builds it) behind src/eagl.c, as
#                                   lib/libOSMesa.8.dylib (15 MB) and lib/libredwood-gl.dylib. Where the
#                                   kernel has started the phone's GPU, CoreAnimation then draws with its
#                                   OpenGL ES renderer, by that GPU (boot-arg gpu=1); anywhere else -- QEMU,
#                                   no boot-arg, no firmware in ../fw-gpu -- the library is not even loaded
#                                   and nothing changes (src/inject.c, opengl_es()).
#                                   GL=test: only the library and bin/gl_test (a triangle, src/gl_test.c;
#                                   RC_JOBS=rc.jobs.gltest runs it); the window server stays as it is.
#                      ADSP=1       with the audio DSP's firmware from ../fw-audio in fw/ (20 MB; for the
#                                   kernel's adsp_step=N, bsd/dev/redwood_adsp.c, which runs before the root is
#                                   mounted). Not beside GL=1: the two do not fit the 64 MB the loader takes with
#                                   the kernel. adsp=1 needs none of it: the system image has the firmware in /fw.
#   system.apfs      the system image, the root filesystem (the resident RAM disk, /dev/md0), an
#                    APFS container: the part of iOS 16.5 chosen by ../ios165/select-system.py at
#                    its real paths, the dyld shared cache, and src/stage0.c as /sbin/launchd (the
#                    real one is /sbin/launchd.ios). 2.5 GB; upload once per loader session with
#                    `xl ramdisk userland/system.apfs`. Rebuilt when missing, when its inputs
#                    (stage0, the manifest, the cryptex files) are newer, or with SYSTEM=1 (after
#                    changing the recipe below).
#   flashboot.apfs   FLASHBOOT=1: the RAM part of a boot whose root is the iOS volume on the phone's
#                    flash (see below); with CRYPTEXES=flash the boot volume alone, the cryptexes being
#                    on the flash. FLASHBOOT=1 also decides what goes into root.apfs: the job list is
#                    then made for the whole iOS volume (mkjobs.py --root-volume), so it holds daemons
#                    -- fairplayd, identityservicesd, passd ... -- that the system image has not got.
#                    That root.apfs is for a flash boot; a RAM boot wants one built without FLASHBOOT=1,
#                    or launchd will fail to start those few when something asks for them.
#
#   PREBUILT=1       do not compile anything: take our programs from ../prebuilt/userland (this is also
#                    what happens when the cross toolchain is not set up, see ../xnu-deps/setup.sh);
#                    the images are then made of them and of the iOS files alone (python3)
#   CHECK=1          check every image (every container) as it is made: apfsck has to find it clean and
#                    the kernel's apfs_lib has to read every volume back as the directory it was made of
#                    (../tools/apfs/check-image.sh; the system image takes a few minutes more)

# kernel starts from (rd=md0): stage0 as /sbin/launchd mounts the small image on /redwood and runs its
# init, which with boot-arg root_apfs=DEV mounts the volume on /flash, makes it the root and moves the
# boot volume to the volume's /private/preboot, then mounts the second container -- the OS cryptex -- on
# the boot volume's empty Cryptexes/OS and the third -- Apple's App cryptex as it is -- on Cryptexes/App:
# /private/preboot/Cryptexes/OS and App, where the volume's own /System/Cryptexes/OS and App point and
# where iOS grafts the cryptexes (src/init.c, flash_root; the kernel's apfs takes "/dev/md0,c=1" and
